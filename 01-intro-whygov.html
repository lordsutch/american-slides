  <p>A <i>government</i> is the set of institutions and processes that decide
    and implement decisions on behalf of a particular <em>polity</em> (a
    given territory or people).</p>

  <p class="fragment">Within the United States, there are many levels
    of government that exercise authority over communities (such as
    cities and counties), states, and territories, as well as our
    national government.</p>

  <h2>The Problem of Justice</h2>

</audio>

  <p>An important role of government in any society is to
  provide <i>justice</i>: fair and equitable outcomes for the people
  within the society.</p>

  <p class=fragment>There are three major forms of justice:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment"><i>Retributive justice</i>: ensuring that those
      who commit crimes are punished accordingly.</li>

    <li class="fragment"><i>Restorative justice</i>: ensuring that the
      harm caused by crimes is repaired, and criminals do not
      reoffend.</li>

    <li class="fragment"><i>Distributive or social justice</i>: ensuring
      a fair distribution of goods or values (material or otherwise)
      to individuals or groups in society.</li>

  </ul>

</section>

  <h2>The State of Nature</h2>

</audio>

  <p>Enlightenment-era philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke,
  and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had competing beliefs about society before
    (or without) government:</p>

  <ul>
  <img alt="The Cover of a 1750 edition of The Leviathan." src="img/intro/Ttitelblatt_1750_Leviathan_Thomas_Hobbs.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%"/>
    <li class="fragment">Hobbes famously believed life for most people
      would be ‚Äúnasty, brutish, and short‚Äù until humans
      banded together to create governments to protect them from others.</li>

  <li class="fragment">Locke and Rousseau believed human nature was
    more peaceful and benevolent than Hobbes did, and that people did
    not give up their rights when they formed governments.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>The Social Contract</h2>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-04.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

<p>Regardless of why humans chose to form governments, all of
  the <i>social contract theorists</i> believed that people within a
  society have agreed to accept certain duties and responsibilities in
  exchange for their government doing the same.

</p><p class="fragment">In our society, the primary obligation of the people
  is to obey the law. In return, our government protects our
  fundamental rights and liberties and provides <i>public goods</i>.

</p></section>

</audio>

  <p>Government today is less concerned with the <i>state of
      nature</i>‚Äîalthough there are still <i>failed states</i>
    like Afghanistan and Somalia.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Most everyone accepts the necessity of government
    (except <i>anarchists</i>), but there is still substantial
    disagreement among Americans about what the proper role of
    government in society should be.</p>

  <h2>Market Failure</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="14,18,21,24" preload="metadata">

<source src="audio/intro/intro-06.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>In capitalist societies, government attempts to solve four major
    forms of <i>market failure</i>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Failure to provide <em>public goods</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Failure to account
      for <em>externalities</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Market power of <em>monopolies</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Lack of <em>equity</em> in outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Failure to Provide Public Goods</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="12,22,23,25,28" preload="metadata">
<source src="audio/intro/intro-07.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source src="audio/intro/intro-07.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <img alt="Aerial view of The Pentagon." src="img/intro/640px-The_Pentagon_US_Department_of_Defense_building.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%"/>

  <p><em>Public goods</em> are essential things needed by a
    society that would not be provided (or would not be provided
    enough) by a free market.</p>

  <p class="fragment"><b>Not everything that the government does is a
      public good!</b> Examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">National defense.</li>
    <li class="fragment">A legal system (courts, prisons, etc.).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Clean air and water.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fragment">Although these things are important, without
    government taxes and regulations, it would be easy for people to
    be <i>free riders</i>: to avoid doing their part to ensure these
    public goods were available.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Problem of Externalities</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="12,23,38" preload="metadata">

<source src="audio/intro/intro-08.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

<p>The actions of individuals (or groups, like businesses) may have
  consequences that affect others.</p>

<p class=fragment>If individuals or groups don't pay the costs of
  these consequences for others (or get extra compensation for the
  benefits from them), they are called <i>externalities</i>.

  </p><ul>
    <li class="fragment">Example of <i>negative</i> externality:
    pollution.</li>

      <!-- Georgia Power burns coal to
      produce electricity. It pays to run the power plant and buy the
      coal to fuel it, and receives money from people and business who
      buy electricity, but in the absence of government regulation the
      costs of the consequences of burning coal on the atmosphere (soot,
      sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, etc.) would be borne by others. -->

    <li class="fragment">Example of <i>positive</i> externality:
    vaccination.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Market Power and Monopolies</h2>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-09.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Under free market competition, consumers normally benefit from
    competition between producers and businesses to lower prices.</p>

  <p class="fragment">However, if one company controls all or most of a
  market, they can force consumers to pay higher prices or provide
    lesser quality of service.</p>

  <p class="fragment">For example, compare cell phones (where
  competition between several major companies leads to lower prices)
  to home Internet service (where only 1 or 2 companies offer service
  to most people).

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>The Problem of Equity</h2>

</audio>

  <p>A capitalist economic system may not lead to outcomes that are
  seen as ‚Äúfair,‚Äù particularly for people who cannot
    afford things that are seen as basic necessities.</p>
  <p class=fragment>In these cases,
  government steps in to ensure access to these things to
  everyone. Examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Food and shelter.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Elementary and secondary education.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Basic health care.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="fragment">Prices of other goods, like water and electricity,
  may be also be regulated to ensure everyone can afford them.</p>

  <p>There is no single definition of <i>politics</i>, but two have
    proven to be enduring:</p>
  <ul>
  <img alt="Republican and Democratic campaign buttons." src="img/intro/buttons.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%"/>
  <li class="fragment">20th century political scientist Harold
      Lasswell: Politics is about ‚Äúwho gets what, when, and
      how.‚Äù</li>
    <li class="fragment">Another political scientist, David Easton:
    ‚Äúthe authoritative allocation of values for a
    society.‚Äù
  </li></ul>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-12.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p class="centered">Politics encompasses the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Deciding <i>material values</i>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Deciding <i>spiritual values</i>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Deciding <i>how to decide</i>.</li>

  <h2>What is Political Science?</h2>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-13.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Modern political scientists apply the methods of the <i>social
      sciences</i> to the systematic study of the theory and practice of
    politics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Political science's roots
      are <i>interdisciplinary</i>, encompassing philosophy, history,
      law, and economics.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Other contemporary social sciences include
      economics, geography, psychology, and sociology.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Personal Liberty</h2>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-14.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Locke's idea of natural rights to ‚Äúlife, liberty, and
    property‚Äù and Mill's <i>harm principle</i> give Americans an
    expectation that government will protect individual personal
    freedoms.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Most of these protections are examples
      of <i>negative liberty</i>: limitations on the government's
      power to interfere with individual freedoms. Most of the Bill of
      Rights, for example, uses terms that limit government power.</p>

  <p class="fragment">On the other hand, <i>positive liberty</i> can be
  thought of as the ability‚Äînot just the opportunity‚Äîto do
    what one wants to do.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Example: political speech.</p>

</section>

  <h2>Power and Authority</h2>

<source src="audio/intro/intro-15.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p><i>Power</i> is the raw ability to force someone else to do something
    that you want them to do.</p>

  <p class="fragment"><i>Authority</i> is the right to exercise power in
  a particular circumstance. For example, the government might be said
  to have the authority to compel citizens to pay their taxes.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legitimacy</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="9,19,32" preload="metadata">
<source src="audio/intro/intro-16.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source src="audio/intro/intro-16.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>The use of authority is said to be <i>legitimate</i> if it rests
    on the law and practices of a society and is recognized as such.</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Americans believe that the person who wins a
  presidential election has legitimacy to exercise the authority and
  power of the presidency.</li>

      <li class="fragment">The <i>illegitimate</i> use of power or authority
        is usually considered illegal.</li>

      <li class="fragment">For example: the actions of the government of
      the Confederacy and the states within it from 1861‚Äì65 were
      not seen as legitimate by the Union and do not have legal effect
      today.
    </li></ul>

</audio>

  <p>In America, most people are citizens by virtue of having been
    born within the United States (<i>jus soli</i>).

  </p><p class="fragment">Other people can become citizens through the process
    of <i>naturalization</i>, which requires legally immigrating to the
    U.S. and then living for several years as a lawful permanent
    resident.

  </p><p class="fragment">Citizens are full members of the political
  community, with both legal obligations and rights.

  <h2>Forms of Government</h2>

  <p>The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed a framework for
    understanding the types of government in his day, based on how many
    ruled and whether it was a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù
    (or <i>corrupted</i>) form:</p>

<table class="fragment" style="text-align: center; border-spacing: 8px; font-size: 61.8%">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Form of Government</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Good Variation</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">Bad Variation</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>Rule By One</th>
    <td>Monarchy</td>
    <td>Tyranny or Autocracy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="fragment">
    <th>Rule By The Few</th>
    <td>Aristocracy</td>
    <td>Oligarchy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="fragment">
    <th>Rule By The Many</th>
    <td>Polity</td>
    <td>Democracy</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p class="fragment">While most modern political systems don't fit well
  into this framework, it did influence the American Founders.</p>

</audio>

  <ul>
  <li><p>At the time of the revolution, many leaders were deeply
    skeptical of unchecked democracy, which they believed would lead
    to ‚ÄúKing Numbers‚Äù and <i>tyranny of the
    majority</i>.</p></li>

  <li class="fragment"><p>Even today, America relies mostly
    on <i>representative democracy</i>: citizens choose leaders to
      govern on their behalf between elections.</p></li>

  <li class="fragment"><p><i>Direct democracy</i>, including
    the <i>referendum</i> and <i>initiative</i>, tends to be used more
    frequently at the state and local level, but not at the national
    level.</p>
