Slides for POLS 1101 American National Government

The live version is at http://amgov.cnlawrence.com/

You'll need Reveal.js for these slides. Get it from

(At some point I should figure out how to make that a submodule.)

Note that there are three "intro" sets of slides; these correspond
with different textbooks. The remaining "chapters" are fairly generic
and should work with most texts.
