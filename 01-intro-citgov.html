  <p>Americans historically have been skeptical of government power,
    particularly giving power to politicians.

  <p class=fragment>However, in times of crisis, Americans have asked
    the government to take on more responsibilities:

    <ul>
      <li class=fragment>The Great Depression
      <li class=fragment>The 9/11 Attacks
      <li class=fragment>The 2008&ndash;09 Economic Crisis
    </ul>

  <h2>Yet Greater Distrust of Government</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/distrust.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Despite asking politicians to &ldquo;do something&rdquo; to solve
  society's problems, Americans are increasingly distrustful of
  government power.

  <p class=fragment>The public's trust in government
    has <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/10/18/trust-in-government-nears-record-low-but-most-federal-agencies-are-viewed-favorably/">declined
    sharply</a> over the past 50 years.

  <p class=fragment>In addition, peoples' sense of <b>political
  efficacy</b>&mdash;the belief that they can affect what the
  government does&mdash;has declined over the last 50 years.

<p class=fragment>Many scholars think these trends are dangerous to
  American democracy.

  <p>Being an engaged citizen requires knowledge about the workings of
    the political system.

  <p class=fragment>The Internet has created new opportunities for
  citizens to engage in political activity and influence
  government&mdash;but people have to take advantage of these
  opportunities.

  <p class=fragment>More knowledgeable citizens have more political
  efficacy and greater trust in government.

<h2>What is Government?</h2>

  <p>A <i>government</i> is the set of institutions and processes that decide
    and implement decisions on behalf of a particular <em>polity</em> (a
    given territory or people).</p>

  <p class="fragment">Within the United States, there are many levels
    of government that exercise authority over communities (such as
    cities and counties), states, and territories, as well as our
    national government.</p>

  <h2>Forms of Government</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="36,64,78" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/formsgov.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Many governments today, and most throughout history, are based on
    an <b>authoritarian</b> system, where the ruler or ruling class
    has few constraints on their power but allow ordinary individuals
    some degree of personal freedom.

  <p class=fragment>In the 20th century, technology
  made <b>totalitarian</b> rule possible; Nazi Germany and North Korea
  are good examples, where government seeks to control all aspects of
  citizens' lives.

  <p class=fragment>On the other hand, in <b>democracies</b>, the people have a
    significant role in politics and government.

  <p class=fragment>This role is often
    guaranteed through <b>constitutional government</b>, a system
    that places limitations on the powers of government and politicians.

  <h2>The State of Nature</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/stateofnature.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Enlightenment-era philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke,
  and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had competing beliefs about society before
    (or without) government:</p>

  <ul>
  <img alt="The Cover of a 1750 edition of The Leviathan." src="img/intro/Ttitelblatt_1750_Leviathan_Thomas_Hobbs.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%"/>
    <li class="fragment">Hobbes famously believed life for most people
      would be ‚Äúnasty, brutish, and short‚Äù until humans
      banded together to create governments to protect them from others.</li>

  <li class="fragment">Locke and Rousseau believed human nature was
    more peaceful and benevolent than Hobbes did, and that people did
    not give up their rights when they formed governments.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>The Social Contract</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="13" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/soccontract.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

<p>Regardless of why humans chose to form governments, all of
  the <i>social contract theorists</i> believed that people within a
  society have agreed to accept certain duties and responsibilities in
  exchange for their government doing the same.</p>

<p class="fragment">In our society, the primary obligation of the people
  is to obey the law. In return, our government protects our
    fundamental rights and liberties and provides <i>public goods</i>.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>What is Politics?</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/politics.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>There is no single definition of <i>politics</i>, but two have
    proven to be enduring:</p>
  <ul>
  <img alt="Republican and Democratic campaign buttons." src="img/intro/buttons.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%"/>
  <li class="fragment">20th century political scientist Harold
      Lasswell: Politics is about ‚Äúwho gets what, when, and
      how.‚Äù</li>
    <li class="fragment">Another political scientist, David Easton:
    ‚Äúthe authoritative allocation of values for a
    society.‚Äù

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/polsci.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Modern political scientists apply the methods of the <i>social
      sciences</i> to the systematic study of the theory and practice of
    politics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Political science's roots
      are <i>interdisciplinary</i>, encompassing philosophy, history,
      law, and economics.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Other contemporary social sciences include
      economics, geography, psychology, and sociology.</li>

  <h2>Direct vs. Representative Democracy</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/directrep.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <ul>
  <li><p>At the time of the American revolution, many leaders were
    deeply skeptical of unchecked democracy, which they believed would
    lead to ‚ÄúKing Numbers‚Äù and <i>tyranny of the
    majority</i>.</p></li>

  <li class="fragment"><p>Even today, America relies mostly
    on <i>representative democracy</i>: citizens choose leaders to
      govern on their behalf between elections.</p></li>

  <li class="fragment"><p><i>Direct democracy</i>, including
    the <i>referendum</i> and <i>initiative</i>, tends to be used more
    frequently at the state and local level, but not at the national
    level.</p>

  <h2>The American Identity</h2>

<img alt="An American flag."
     src="img/intro-citgov/640px-US_Flag_Backlit.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 40%"/>

  <p>What does it mean to be an American? The answer to this question
  has changed over time as our nation's population has grown and
    become more diverse in its origins.

  <p class=fragment>Throughout American history, immigration and the
    demographic changes that come with it have led to political debate:

    <ul>
      <li class=fragment>The slave trade before 1808.
      <li class=fragment>Catholic European immigration in the mid/late 1800s.
      <li class=fragment>Asian immigration in the late 1800s.
      <li class=fragment>Immigration from the developing world since
        World War II.
    </ul>

  <h2>Founding Ideas</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="14,15,16" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/foundingideas.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>More so than race or ethnicity or religion, American identity is
    based on fundamental ideas or values:

    <ul>
      <li class=fragment>Liberty
      <li class=fragment>Equality
      <li class=fragment>Democracy
    </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Liberty: Freedom!</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="8,22,38" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/liberty.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/liberty.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

    <img alt="Statue of Liberty."
    src="img/intro-citgov/598px-USA-NYC-Statue_of_Liberty.jpg"
         style="float: right; width: 30%"/>

  <p>The American ideal of <b>liberty</b> rests on freedom from
    government control of our personal and economic lives.</p>

  <p class=fragment>The idea of <b>limited government</b> reflects a
    concern for liberty.
    <!-- Reflected in the saying &ldquo;The best
  government is that which governs least,&rdquo; often attributed to
    Thomas Jefferson. -->
  </p>

  <p class=fragment>How absolute should our personal liberty be? Today it is
    expansive but certainly not unlimited.</p>

  <p class=fragment>Similarly, most Americans today reject
    unbridled, <b>laissez-faire capitalism</b> and favor some
    regulation of the economy, but still prefer capitalism and the
    private sector more than people in most other countries.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Equality: Fair Treatment under the Law</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="6,16,28" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/equality.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-citgov/equality.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Equality to Americans has multiple components:

  <ul>
    <li class=fragment><p><b>Equality of opportunity:</b> the right to
      succeed or fail on one's own merits.
    <li class=fragment><p><b>Political equality:</b> all people have an equal
      standing to participate in politics and government.
    <li class=fragment><p>However, government efforts to ensure
        greater <b>equality of outcomes</b> (social and economic
        equality) are much more politically controversial.
  </ul>

  <h2>Democracy: Popular Sovereignty</h2>

</audio>

<img alt="A ballot box."
     src="img/intro-citgov/640px-Election_MG_3455.jpeg"
     style="float: right; width: 25%"/>

  <p>Americans also believe that they should choose our rulers and have
    influence over their decisions.</p>

  <p class=fragment>Ultimately, our system is based on the idea that
    all government power comes from the citizenry itself, known
    as <b>popular sovereignty</b>.</p>

  <p class=fragment>Most Americans believe strongly in <b>majority
  rule</b>; however, this is balanced by our system
    against <b>minority rights</b>.</p>
